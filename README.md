# minecraft-on-k8s
This is a WIP project where I built an MC server on Kubernetes


# Dependancies

This is in large part thanks to the work over at https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server and https://github.com/itzg/minecraft-server-charts
I took a large amount of what was working over there and applied it in this format. So BIG shout out to itzg.
